# Fractured Mind by Top Zombies
## Rocky Mountain Game Developers - Game Jam 2019

## Description
Dive deep into the mind of Katheryn Davis to discover the truth behind her past. Explore the repressed memories of her family’s brutal murder so she may find the hope she needs to move forward with her life.

## Details
As a child, Katheryn Davis was the sole survivor of a brutal serial killer attack. Years later she yearns to learn the truth behind what happened, which she has repressed, so that she may find the courage and hope she needs to move on with her life.

With the help of new technology, developed by the Doctor, she is about to dive into her memories in a dream-like state. There she must face her inner demons and explore the dark corners of her mind to reveal what she already knows, but is too afraid to recognize. But the truth may be far more than anyone realizes…

Fractured Mind is a first-person adventure horror game developed by Top Zombies for the 1st Rocky Mountain Game Developer’s Gam Jam.
